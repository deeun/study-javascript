                Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low I.Q. but good
                intentions. He is running through childhood with his best and
                only friend Jenny. His 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and
                leaves him to choose his destiny. Forrest joins the army for
                service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he
                wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires
                people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the smiley,
                writes bumper stickers and songs, donates to people and meets
                the president several times. However, this is all irrelevant to
                Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny
                Curran, who has messed up her life. Although in the end all he
                wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.
